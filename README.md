**C64 Visual TAP** is a tool for converting audio signal recorded from Commodore 64 tapes to the TAP format. It allows to control this process visually and adjust parsing parameters and even edit resulted TAP. This tool can help to prepare TAP file before passing it to cleaning procedures with [TAPClean](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tapclean/). It could be used in conjunction with the audio editor, for identifying the problematic locations in the record for subsequent possible restoration and for achieving a better quality of the conversion.
